# Singly Linked List

* *Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node *
* *with your linked list class include a head*
* *the class should contain the following methods[insert , includes , to string]*

## Challenge

* *Createing a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.*

**Createing a Linked List Class**

* *insert : Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.*
* *toString : returns all the nodes in a list in a String format.*
* *include : checks if a value in the list exist*


## Approach & Efficiency

* *i undertand the problem first*
* *I imagined how the results should be*
* *I wrote the code*
* *I made the tests*

## API

* *include(): this method compare input value if it's exist in linked list.*
* *Insert(): which takes value of type any adding new node with the input value to the list.*
* *toString(): return a string visiulizing the linked list shape.*
